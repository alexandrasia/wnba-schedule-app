# TODO

## High Priority
- [ ] Add error handling for failed API requests
- [ ] Integrate calendar with game data (show game indicators on dates)

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add caching for API responses
- [ ] Add filtering/search capabilities for games
- [ ] Enhance calendar to show game count per date
- [ ] Add game status badges (Live, Final, Scheduled)
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle (Shadcn supports this out of the box)
- [ ] Add animations for card selection/hover states

## Questions to Resolve
- What should happen when a user selects a game? (Display game details, add to favorites, etc.)
- Should we implement server-side caching for API responses?
- Are there other views needed besides the calendar and card grid views?
