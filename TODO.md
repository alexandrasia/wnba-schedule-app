# TODO

## High Priority - v0 Design Implementation
- [ ] Multi-league filter toggles (WNBA, NBA, NHL, PWHL)
- [ ] Calendar integration showing selected games with visual indicators
- [ ] Export to ICS functionality for calendar apps
- [ ] Select All button for batch selection
- [ ] Badge counters showing selection count
- [ ] Two-tab interface (Schedule view vs Selected Games view)
- [ ] Improved game card design matching v0 screenshot

## High Priority - General
- [ ] Add error handling for failed API requests
- [ ] Integrate calendar with game data (show game indicators on dates)

## Future Enhancements - Features
- [ ] Add caching for API responses
- [ ] Add filtering/search capabilities for games
- [ ] Enhance calendar to show game count per date
- [ ] Add game status badges (Live, Final, Scheduled)
- [ ] Add animations for card selection/hover states

## Questions to Resolve
- What should happen when a user selects a game? (Display game details, add to favorites, etc.)
- Should we implement server-side caching for API responses?
- Are there other views needed besides the calendar and card grid views?
- How should the league switcher work in production? (User preference vs. auto-detect from data)
